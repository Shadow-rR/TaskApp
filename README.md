# TaskApp
First open a terminal and go to the api file and create a virtual environment by : python -m venv flaskenv
if using conda use : conda create --name flaskenv 
By now you should have a folder named flaskenv
Then you have to activate the virtual env 
Run: pip install -r requirements.txt
and then execute python api.py

Open another terminal to the root of this repository : npm install (install npm before this)
then : npm start

This should open up the react app
